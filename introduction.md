The meaning of each sequence made of three nucleotides (also known as a *codon* or *codon triplet*), as read by the ribosome. Each codon should be spelt starting from the inner circle and going outwards. Out of 64 combinations, three are recognised as "stop signals", while the rest encode amino acids, with the exception of the AUG codon which, in addition to represent methionine, is also typically used to initiate protein syntesis. Most amino acids (excluding methionine and tryptophan) are encoded by more than a single codon.
