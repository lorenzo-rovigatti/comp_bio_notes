In order to do so we define the transition probability matrix $A_{i \\to j}$ to go from state $i$ to state $j$, with the obvious constraint that its elements have to be such that the equilibrium distribution is conserved. A sufficient condition to fulfill such a constraint is that, for each pair $i, j$,\n",

After this equilibration we begin to keep track of the helicity, so that at the end of the simulation we can return its value, averaged over the ensemble of generated configurations.\n",
    "\n",

First of all, note that we don't need the single statistical weights of the $i$ and $j$ configurations, but only their ratio. Moreover, in the Zimm-Bragg model the total weight of the chain can be decomposed in the product of the weights associated to each residue, *viz.*\n",
